    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is an audio generator tool to explore the timbral quality imparted
        by applying one of several filters to an incoming signal. The top box
        is an oscilloscope view which visualizes the waveform, and the bottom
        box is a harmonic spectrum view.
    </p>

    <p>This tool generates white noise at an adjustable amplitude, and allows
        you to adjust the type and parameters of the filter, as well the
        overall output amplitude (volume). The filter parameters are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><i>f<sub>0</sub></i> (center frequency) &mdash; <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>
            is the frequency at which the filter is most active and at which
            the frequency response of the filter "pivots."
        </li>
        <li><i>Q</i> (quality) &mdash; <i>Q</i> is a measure of how steep the
            dropoff is of the frequency response curve around
            <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>. A low <i>Q</i> means that the
            frequency curve ramps gently down, such that the filter encompasses
            a relatively wider portion of the spectrum. A high <i>Q</i> means
            that the frequency curve ramps steeply down, such that the
            filter encompasses a relatively narrower portion of the
            spectrum. <i>Q</i> must be a positive (non-zero) value.
        </li>
        <li>type &mdash; There are four basic types of filter. In each
            case, the filter performs a transformation from its input harmonic
            spectrum, with a "pivot" at <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>. The filter
            type indicates the general shape of the transformation:
            <ul>
                <li>low-pass &mdash; The filter passes (allows) frequencies
                    lower than <i>f<sub>0</sub></i> and rejects (squelches)
                    frequencies above <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>.
                </li>
                <li>high-pass &mdash; The filter passes frequencies
                    higher than <i>f<sub>0</sub></i> and rejects
                    frequencies below <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>.
                </li>
                <li>band-pass &mdash; The filter passes frequencies
                    near <i>f<sub>0</sub></i> and rejects frequencies
                    away from <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>.
                </li>
                <li>notch (band-reject) &mdash; The filter passes
                    frequencies away from <i>f<sub>0</sub></i> and rejects
                    frequencies near <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>Because <i>Q</i> is not allowed to be zero, when you adjust its
        slider all the way down, you instead get a small but positive value.
    </p>

    <p>There is no upper limit to <i>Q</i>, but this demo limits it to
        500. This more or less covers the useful range for sound synthesis.
    </p>

    <p>At higher <i>Q</i> the filter becomes significantly "resonant." That is,
        even if you cut off the input (by setting the amplitude to zero), you
        will still see output with energy at <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>. It will
        eventually decay.
    </p>

    <p>It can be hard to tell what a notch filter is doing at higher <i>Q</i>,
        both audibly and in terms of the spectrum. When using a notch filter,
        you'll probably have better results with <i>Q</i> under 5.
    </p>

    <p>It's easy to pick filter parameters which will "blow out" the output
        out of the valid-for-audio range of -1 to 1. The straightforward way
        to correct for this is simply to lower either the input or output
        amplitude. If you don't, the main thing you will notice is that you
        end up with extra peaks in the output harmonics, which correspond to
        the "shelves" caused by the cutoff of the waveform at either extreme of
        instantaneous amplitude.
    </p>

    <p>The filters implemented in this demo are two-pole infinite impulse
        response (IIR) filter. The "infinite" in the name means that filter
        output at any given point in time depends on <i>all</i> of the
        input that the filter has ever received. This is in contrast to a
        finite impulse response (FIR) filter, which only depends on a
        limited rolling window of previous input to the filter. (In digital
        filters, this window is generally one sample per pole.)
    </p>

    <p>The four basic types of filter demonstrated here aren't the only kinds of
        filter. There are many others. Roughly speaking, though, one can think
        of any filter as a combination of the types described here.
