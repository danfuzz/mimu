The original _Awk Music_ composition is by Kyle Keen. See
<http://kmkeen.com/awk-music/>.

The pink noise generator is based on
[PinkNoise.java](http://sampo.kapsi.fi/PinkNoise) by Sampo Niskane
and on the [gaussian random number generator](http://blog.yjl.im/2010/09/simulating-normal-random-variable-using.html)
by Yu-Jie Lin, which is in turn based on other sources as cited.

The basic script audio routing code was originally based on example code from
Mozilla, though it has evolved significantly in the mean time. See
<http://mdn.github.io/script-processor-node/>.
