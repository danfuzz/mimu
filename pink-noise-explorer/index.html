    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is an audio generator tool to explore the timbral quality of the
        pink noise family of waveforms. The top box is an oscilloscope view
        which visualizes the waveform, and the bottom box is a harmonic
        spectrum view.
    </p>

    <p>Pink noise is characterized as having a harmonic curve where amplitude
        slopes down from low to high frequencies. More technically, pink noise
        is parameterized on a variable <i>&alpha;</i> (alpha); at a given
        frequency <i>f</i>, the amplitude is 1/<i>f<sup> &alpha;</sup></i>.
        <i>&alpha;</i> can range from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
    </p>

    <p>For "normal" pink noise &mdash; what is sometimes imprecisely just
        called "pink noise" per se &mdash; <i>&alpha;</i> is 1, which means
        that there is equal energy across all octaves. At the extreme of
        <i>&alpha;</i> = 0, the generated noise is actually white noise, that is,
        equal energy at all frequencies. At the other extreme of
        <i>&alpha;</i> = 2, the generated noise is brown noise, which is an
        integration over white noise; the waveform's instantaneous amplitude
        takes the form of brownian motion.
    </p>

    <p>This tool allows you to adjust <i>&alpha;</i> as well as the overall
        amplitude of the sound.

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>At higher <i>&alpha;</i>, there is relatively high energy in the
        very-low frequency range. This can cause the waveform to wander
        significantly out of the valid-for-audio range -1 to 1. This demo
        adjusts for that implicitly: As you raise <i>&alpha;</i>, the overall
        amplitude is adjusted downward. It's not a perfect adjustment, though,
        so you might find that you need to manually adjust amplitude up or
        down, depending on what you're aiming for.
    </p>

    <p>True brown noise (<i>&alpha;</i> = 2) is not actually fruitful when
        turned into an audio waveform, but it can still fun to look at.
        However, don't be surprised if you end up looking at an empty
        display when the waveform strays far out of range (per the previous
        note).
    </p>

    <p>The noise is generated in this demo by using an IIR (infinite impulse
        response) filter with five poles. The result is not mathematically
        100% accurate, however this is generally considered close enough for
        most audio applications.
