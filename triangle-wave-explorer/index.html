    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is an audio generator tool to explore the timbral quality of the
        triangle wave family of waveforms, including both symmetric and
        asymmetric variants. The top box is an oscilloscope view
        which visualizes the waveform, and the bottom box is a harmonic
        spectrum view.
    </p>

    <p>Three different symmetries of the wave are parameterized and can be
        controlled to "bias" the wave away from symmetrical. These symmetries
        / biases are:

        <ul>
            <li>downward&ndash;upward bias &mdash; In a symmetric triangle wave,
                there is equal representation in the portions of the waveform
                which have an upward (positive) slope and those which have a
                downward (negative) slope. A negative bias skews representation
                towards the downward-sloping portion. A positive bias on this
                control skews representation towards the upward-sloping portion
                of the waveform. At the extremes of this bias, the
                waveform becomes a sawtooth wave.
            </li>
            <li>negative&ndash;positive bias &mdash; In a symmetric triangle
                wave, there is equal representation of positive and negative
                values. A negative bias on this control skews representation
                towards negative values. A positive bias on this control skews
                representation towards positive values.
            </li>
            <li>de&auml;mping&ndash;amping bias &mdash; In a symmetric triangle
                wave, there is equal representation of value movement away from
                zero (amping up) and value movement towards zero (de&auml;amping
                or amping down). A negative bias on this control skews
                representation towards de&auml;amping. A positive bias on this
                control skews representation towards amping up.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In addition, you can change the pitch (frequency) and total amplitude of
        the note being played. Adjusting these can help discern the various
        patterns of the displays.

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>At many frequencies, you can observe harmonics that are not even
        multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, if you ramp up
        the pitch slowly, you can see these harmonics "bounce off the wall."
        These are <i>aliasing artifacts</i> which are produced because the
        period (single cycle) of the waveform isn't a whole number of samples.
        The demo code reduces &mdash; but does not eliminate &mdash; this effect
        by oversampling, that is, by producing samples at a higher rate than the
        output sample rate. In this case, those samples are simply averaged
        together, a tactic which serious audio engineers would probably scoff at
        but which is both effective and efficient for the current use case.
