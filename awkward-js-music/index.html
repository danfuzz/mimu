    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is a rough translation (close but not 100% faithful) from AWK
        to JavaScript of the musical composition
        <a href="http://kmkeen.com/awk-music/">AWK Music</a> by Kyle Keen,
        with bonus waveform selection and visualization (oscilloscope above
        and harmonic spectrum below).
    </p>

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>The basic audio element of this demo is a pair of simple waves of
        different frequencies, which are played in unison. You can pick
        among a few options for the basic waveform:

        <ul>
            <li>sine &mdash; Sine waves are, harmonically, the simplest
                possible waveforms. They generally have a "pure" sound to
                human ears, which might remind you of a kalimba (finger piano).
            </li>
            <li>triangle &mdash; Triangle waves are simple geometrically, yet
                harmonically rich and mellow to human ears. The sound might
                remind you of a marimba (wooden xylophone). This is the default
                waveform choice, as this is the choice made by Keen in his
                original composition.
            </li>
            <li>sawtooth &mdash; Sawtooth waves tend to sound buzzy and a bit
                harsh to human ears. The sound might remind you of a reed
                instrument such as an oboe or clarinet.
            </li>
            <li>square &mdash; Square waves also have a buzziness about them.
                The sound might remind you a little bit of a recorder
                (woodwind).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The notes played by this demo are picked randomly from two octaves in an
        equal-tempered pentatonic scale. This is not a scale that is often
        encountered in Western music, however it happens to make for note
        pairs and transitions that are pleasing to human ears.
    </p>

    <p>The waveform is intentionally level-quantized to simulate low bit-depth.
        You can see this quantization in the oscilloscope as "stair steps" which
        are most visible in gently-sloping portions of the waveform. (That is,
        the stair steps are <i>not</i> a visual artifact from the oscilloscope
        rendering, but rather an accurate reflection of the waveform
        being generated.) In terms of the sound you hear, this quantization
        causes a quiet high-pitched "shimmering" effect.
