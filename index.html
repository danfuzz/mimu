<h2>Milk Music: Demos and Library</h2>

<h3>The Demos</h3>

<ul class="demoList">
  <li><a href="./awkward-js-music/">AWKward JS Music</a></li>
  <li><a href="./filter-explorer/">Filter Explorer</a></li>
  <li><a href="./pink-noise-explorer/">Pink Noise Explorer</a></li>
  <li><a href="./triangle-wave-explorer/">Triangle Wave Explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>
  This is a small collection of programmatically-generated music / audio
  demos. All of the audio processing of these demos takes place inside
  the web browser; there is no server code involved at all.
</p>

<p>
  The code here is meant to serve as straightforward examples
  of how to do script-based audio generation and analysis using the
  JavaScript <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio API</a>.
  Most of the code is in library form, ready for importation into other
  projects. Please use it!
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/danfuzz/mimu">See the source</a>. If you're
  specifically looking for the Web Audio code, find it in the
  <a href="https://github.com/danfuzz/mimu/tree/main/lib/MusicControl.js">
  <code>MusicControl</code> class</a>.
</p>

<h3>Items of note</h3>

<p>
  As of this writing, the per-demo controls do not seem to work
  consistently when using Safari. This is because Safari &mdash;
  sometimes! &mdash; doesn't seem to promptly pass messages from the main
  browser thread to the <code>AudioWorkletProcessor</code> which
  generates the raw samples. It is unclear why this is(n't) happening.
</p>

<p>
  The original version of this code was written in 2015, using browser and
  JavaScript features which were still new and/or experimental at the
  time. As such, this project inevitably suffered code rot, and it had
  stopped working sometime around 2019. In 2023, I did a chunk of work to
  get things working again. That said, I have yet to fully clean up the
  code such that it is up to arguably-modern standards.
</p>

<h3>One final word</h3>
