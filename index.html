    <h2>Milk Music: Demos and Library</h2>

    <h3>The Demos</h3>

    <ul id="#demoList">
        <li><a href="./awkward-js-music/">AWKward JS Music</a></li>
        <li><a href="./filter-explorer/">Filter Explorer</a></li>
        <li><a href="./pink-noise-explorer/">Pink Noise Explorer</a></li>
        <li><a href="./triangle-wave-explorer/">Triangle Wave Explorer</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is a small collection of programmatically-generated music / audio
        demos. All of the audio processing of these demos takes place inside
        the web browser; there is no server code involved at all.
    </p>

    <p>The code here is meant to serve as straightforward examples
        of how to do script-based audio generation and analysis using the
        JavaScript <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio API</a>.
        Most of the code is in library form, ready for importation into other
        projects. Please use it!
    </p>

        specifically looking for the Web Audio code, find it in the
        <a href="https://github.com/danfuzz/mimu/tree/master/lib/MusicControl.js">
        <code>MusicControl</code> class</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>The original version of this code was written in 2015, using browser and
        JavaScript features which were still new and/or experimental at the
        time. As such, this project inevitably suffered code rot and stopped
        working sometime around 2019. In 2023, I did a chunk of work to get
        things working again, but it is not complete. The only demo that does
        anything particularly nice is <i>AWKward JS Music</i>. I hope to get it
        all happy again in the not-too-distant future.

    <h3>One final word</h3>
