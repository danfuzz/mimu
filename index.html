    <h2>Milk Music: Demos and Library</h2>

    <h3>The Demos</h3>

    <ul id="#demoList">
        <li><a href="./awkward-js-music/">AWKward JS Music</a></li>
        <li><a href="./filter-explorer/">Filter Explorer</a></li>
        <li><a href="./pink-noise-explorer/">Pink Noise Explorer</a></li>
        <li><a href="./triangle-wave-explorer/">Triangle Wave Explorer</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is this?</h3>

    <p>This is a small collection of programmatically-generated music / audio
        demos. All of the audio processing of these demos takes place inside
        the web browser; there is no server code involved at all.
    </p>

    <p>The code here is meant to serve as straightforward examples
        of how to do script-based audio generation and analysis using the
        JavaScript <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio API</a>.
        Most of the code is in library form, ready for importation into other
        projects. Please use it!
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/danfuzz/mimu">See the source</a>. If you're
        specifically looking for the Web Audio code, find it in the
        <a href="https://github.com/danfuzz/mimu/tree/main/lib/MusicControl.js">
        <code>MusicControl</code> class</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Items of note</h3>

    <p>As of this writing, the per-demo controls do not seem to work
        consistently when using Safari. This is because Safari &mdash;
        sometimes! &mdash; doesn't seem to promptly pass messages from the main
        browser thread to the <code>AudioWorkletProcessor</code> which
        generates the raw samples. It is unclear why this is(n't) happening.
    </p>

    <p>The original version of this code was written in 2015, using browser and
        JavaScript features which were still new and/or experimental at the
        time. As such, this project inevitably suffered code rot, and it had
        stopped working sometime around 2019. In 2023, I did a chunk of work to
        get things working again. That said, I have yet to fully clean up the
        code such that it is up to arguably-modern standards.
    </p>
